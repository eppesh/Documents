>

>
> **But** later, when he started working, he met some young people who were handling major responsibilities. And they preferred to dress up. And the professor thought that that looked very sharp. So he started dressing the same way. **Therefore, these are good examples of** reference groups.

1st: State the Topic : Two Trapping mechanisms of carnivorous plants; 

2nd: Sub-Topic 1: Active trap; 

3rd-5th: Example 1: Venus flytrap

- Two halves of the leaves open and close; 

- When insects land, leaves close and form a cage; 

- Digest it & Get nutrients.

6th: Sub-Topic 2: Passive trap;

7th-9th: Example 2: Sundew plant;

- Hairs on leaves produce a super sticky glue like substance; 

- When insects land, they get glued;

- Digest it & Get nutrients.

10th: Conclusion: Therefore, these are the two trapping mechanisms. 

> Well, the professor talks about two trapping mechanisms of carnivorous plants. The first mechanism is called the active trap, just like the Venus flytrap. You know, two halves of their leaves can open and close. So when insects land on leaves, leaves just close and form a cage. So the insects are trapped. And plants can digest insects and get nutrients.
>
> Besides, another trapping mechanism is called passive trap, just like the Sundew plant. You know, they have lots of hairs on leaves, which produce a super sticky glue like substance. So when insects land on the leaves, they just get glued. And sundew plant can digest insects and absorb nutrients. 
>
> Therefore, these are the two trapping mechanisms.
